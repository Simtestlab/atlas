# Fleet Management System

## Introduction to Fleet Management

### 1.1 Definition and Scope
Fleet Management is the integrated process of overseeing, optimizing, and organizing a company's commercial assets—including vehicles, vessels, or aircraft—from acquisition to disposal.  
Its primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, reduce operating costs, strengthen safety, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### 1.2 Key Components of a Fleet
The effectiveness of fleet operations hinges on four interconnected pillars:

- **Vehicles:** The physical assets being managed.  
- **People:** Drivers, mechanics, dispatchers, and management staff.  
- **Processes:** The defined workflows for maintenance, dispatch, and compliance.  
- **Data:** Information gathered via telematics, fuel cards, and inspections, which drives optimization.

### 1.3 Role of the Fleet Manager
The Fleet Manager is responsible for the strategic oversight of the fleet's lifecycle and performance, encompassing:

- **Asset Lifecycle Management:** Vehicle acquisition, utilization, and disposal.  
- **Driver Management:** Training, behavior monitoring, and performance reviews.  
- **Maintenance:** Scheduling, diagnostics, and repair oversight.  
- **Cost Control:** Fuel management and overall budget adherence.  
- **Compliance:** Ensuring adherence to safety and regulatory standards (e.g., HOS, IFTA).
