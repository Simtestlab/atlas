## Overall implementation recommendations

- Use a component-driven approach: small, focused components (TopBar, PageShell, DataTable, FormInput, Modal).
- Centralize data fetching (hooks or services) and use caching for lists (e.g., React Query).
- Prioritize accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, high-contrast modes, keyboard support.
- For images: consider moving to an `images/` subfolder if you plan to add many more assets; update links accordingly.

If you'd like, I can:
- Move all images into `images/` and update links.
- Rename files to remove spaces and update links.
- Generate a compact gallery view or a printable Markdown/Word-friendly export layout.
