# Documentation System Analysis

The documentation subsystem is designed following a **document-as-code** philosophy, integrating technical writing directly into the software development workflow. This ensures that documentation remains synchronized with the evolving codebase and benefits from the same development tools and practices, such as version control and automated builds.

---

## 1. Document Processing Flow

The documentation process begins with the creation of **source files** in **AsciiDoc format (`.adoc`)** by technical writers. These files are written in plain text with lightweight markup, allowing for easy editing and versioning. The **processing engine**, powered by **AsciiDoctor Core (`@asciidoctor/core`)**, converts the AsciiDoc content into web-ready formats such as **HTML** and **PDF**.

Once processed, the generated documents are **integrated** into the web application and delivered through dedicated routes such as `/documentation`. This enables seamless access for users through the existing user interface, maintaining consistency between documentation and application content. The **presentation layer** ensures a clear, professional display of documents, aligning with the system’s UI standards.

---

## 2. Technical Implementation Pattern

The documentation pipeline operates across multiple logical layers:

- **Content Layer:** Technical writers author content using semantic AsciiDoc markup that defines document structure and hierarchy.  
- **Processing Layer:** The AsciiDoctor engine interprets and transforms AsciiDoc files into presentable formats.  
- **Presentation Layer:** Web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript enhance readability, interactivity, and visual design.  
- **Integration Layer:** The processed content is embedded into the Next.js application, allowing documentation pages to coexist with other functional routes.

This multi-layered architecture ensures **modularity**, **scalability**, and **ease of maintenance**.

---

## 3. Information Design Philosophy

The design follows a **structured, automation-friendly approach** emphasizing consistency, collaboration, and reliability. Key principles include:

- **Version Control:** Documentation is stored alongside source code in the same repository, ensuring synchronization between technical updates and corresponding documentation.  
- **Collaborative Editing:** Multiple contributors can work concurrently on content, leveraging branching and pull request workflows.  
- **Automated Processing:** Build systems automatically generate documentation during deployment, eliminating manual intervention.  
- **Consistency Enforcement:** Standardized markup templates and style guides maintain visual and structural uniformity across documents.

This methodology enhances **maintainability**, **accuracy**, and **long-term quality** of documentation.

---

## 4. User Experience Strategy

From a usability standpoint, the documentation system prioritizes **accessibility**, **clarity**, and **adaptability**.

Users can navigate the content via a **left-side table of contents (TOC)** for quick access to sections. Each section includes **anchors and numbered headings**, supporting **deep linking** and improving search engine discoverability. For offline use, **print-optimized layouts** provide professional output formats.

Additionally, through **progressive enhancement**, the documentation remains functional even without JavaScript, while modern browsers benefit from **interactive features** and **improved readability**.

![Kanban reference image](kanban-board.png)

### Structural Components
- **Column Container:**  
  Implemented using MUI `Box` or `Paper` components to represent task columns such as *Backlog*, *Freeze*, *In Progress*, and *Release*.
- **Card Component:**  
  Each card represents a work item or issue, implemented using `Card` from MUI. Cards are stackable and visually grouped by status.
- **Add Item Button:**  
  A floating or anchored MUI `Button` with an icon allows adding new tasks to the respective column.
- **Card Click Navigation:**  
  Clicking a card triggers a route transition using Next.js routing to a detailed issue page (similar to GitHub’s issue navigation).
- **Drag-and-Drop Support (Optional):**  
  The design accommodates the integration of libraries such as `react-beautiful-dnd` or `@hello-pangea/dnd` for rearranging cards between columns.
### Visual Design & UX Notes
- Clear, minimalist layout ideal for status-based task visualization.
- Modular design allows scaling by adding columns or modifying card content.
- Simple interaction logic: Add → View → Drag/Move → Update.
- Balanced spacing and use of consistent typography support clarity.
