' Relationships
scheduler --> abstractEssController : triggers execution cycle
abstractEssController --> channels : read SoC, Pgrid, Pbat, Ppv
abstractEssController --> batteryDevice : set charge/discharge limits
abstractEssController --> batteryInverter : send power setpoints
abstractEssController --> virtualEssAggregator : manage combined ESSs
abstractEssController --> core : publish state + log events

peakShavingController -down-|> abstractEssController
selfConsumptionController -down-|> abstractEssController
prepareChargeController -down-|> abstractEssController
balancingController -down-|> abstractEssController
gridFeedinLimitationController -down-|> abstractEssController

backend --> websocketApi : send commands / get telemetry
websocketApi --> abstractEssController : update targets / parameters

note bottom of abstractEssController
Handles:
- SoC evaluation
- Power reference calculation
- Charge/discharge setpoints
- Grid and PV coordination
- Safety limits (current, voltage, temperature)
