## Description

**Project Overview**
This project involves the development of a lithium cell emulation system designed to replicate the behavior of a 12-cell lithium battery pack. The system emulates cell voltages without the need for real cells, providing a controlled, safe, and flexible environment for testing battery management systems (BMS) or other related applications.

**Key Features**

1. 12-Series Cell Configuration: Simulates a 12-cell lithium battery pack in series, delivering individually adjustable cell voltages.
2. Voltage Source: Utilizes a 48V DC power input, divided into 12 distinct cell voltages using a precision circuit.
3. DAC-Controlled Voltages: Implements the high-precision DAC AD5721R to control the cell voltages dynamically via SPI communication.
4. External Microcontroller Integration: Allows an external microcontroller to programmatically adjust the cell voltages for emulation purposes.
5. Power Transistor Control: Employs MOSFETs or BJTs to amplify the DAC output, enabling robust control of individual cell voltages.
6. Accuracy and Stability: Uses optional buffer op-amps to maintain voltage stability and reduce noise.
