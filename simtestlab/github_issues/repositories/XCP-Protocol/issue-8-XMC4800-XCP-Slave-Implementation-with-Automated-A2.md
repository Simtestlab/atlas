## Description

DOD:
###  1.Code Implementation
 XCP slave functionality is implemented on the XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit using DAVE IDE.
 Code adheres to coding standards and best practices (e.g., naming conventions, comments, error handling).
 No critical bugs or memory leaks detected in the firmware.
 Code is successfully compiled without errors or warnings in DAVE IDE.
 Firmware runs as expected on the XMC4800 board.
**2. A2L File Generation**
 A Python script (generate_a2l.py) correctly parses the ELF file and generates an A2L file.
 The A2L file includes all necessary parameters for calibration and measurement.
 Validation of the generated A2L file using industry-standard tools (e.g., TS Master).
 Clear documentation on how to use the script, including input/output format.
3. ELF/HEX/MAP File Handling
 Firmware build process successfully generates ELF, HEX, and MAP files.
 Conversion script (convert_elf_hex.py) accurately converts ELF files to HEX.
 The generated HEX file can be flashed to the XMC4800 board without errors.
 MAP file analysis ensures correct memory allocation and mapping.
4. Communication Testing
 Successful bidirectional communication with TS Master tool over XCP on CAN.
 Measurement and calibration functions verified with real-time data exchange.
 Data integrity and accuracy validated during XCP sessions.
5. Documentation
 README file includes project setup, usage instructions, and troubleshooting.
 A2L file usage is documented with step-by-step instructions.
 Code is commented and includes explanations of critical functions.
 A project architecture diagram is provided.
6. Repository Management
 Git repository includes source code, scripts, and documentation.
 Clear commit history following conventional commit messages (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:).
 .gitignore file properly configured to exclude unnecessary files.
 Project structure follows standard directory conventions.
7. Testing & Verification
 Unit tests conducted for critical functions where applicable.
 Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing performed on XMC4800.
 Test results documented and approved by stakeholders.
 Edge cases and failure scenarios validated.
8. Deployment Readiness
 Final HEX file tested and validated for production deployment.
 Deployment guide prepared for flashing the firmware on multiple devices.
 Backup and rollback procedures documented.
