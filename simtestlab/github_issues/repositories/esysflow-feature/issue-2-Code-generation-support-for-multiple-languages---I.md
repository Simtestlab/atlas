## Description

DOD: As a developer implement code generation support for languages like Python, XML and a dynamic generation system for most modern languages.

Hint: As reactflow is based on the JSON structure, we need to find a framework/package which turns a JSON structure into code. And then can improvide the code generation part support for multiple languages.
