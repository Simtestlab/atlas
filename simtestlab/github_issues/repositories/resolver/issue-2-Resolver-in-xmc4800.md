## Description

DOD :This project demonstrates how to generate continuous sine and cosine waveforms using the Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) of the XMC4800 microcontroller. The output waveforms are produced by utilizing a lookup table (LUT) containing precomputed values for sine and cosine functions and are updated at regular intervals using a timer interrupt.
