## Description

✅ Definition of Done (DoD)
1. ✅ Hardware Setup
 XMC4800 board is configured and operational with CAN transceiver connected.

 Beckhoff EL6751 CANopen terminal is installed in the EtherCAT chain.

 Proper power supply and connections for EtherCAT and CAN nodes.

 CAN termination resistors are correctly set.

2. ✅ Firmware Development
 CAN peripheral initialized using DAVE IDE or manual register setup.

 CANopen protocol stack integrated (e.g., CANopenNode or MicroCANopen).

 SDO, PDO, and NMT communication implemented and validated.

 CANopen device is discoverable and operational in EL6751.

 State transitions (Pre-Operational, Operational, etc.) handled properly.

 Device heartbeat and node guarding implemented.

 Data object dictionary defined with essential mappings.

3. ✅ EtherCAT/EL6751 Configuration
 EL6751 configured in TwinCAT 3 as a CANopen Master.

 TwinCAT project includes the CANopen slave device (XMC4800).

 Correct baud rate and CANopen parameters set in EL6751.

 PDO mappings in EL6751 match firmware implementation.

 Data exchange from EtherCAT master to CANopen slave (and vice versa) confirmed.

4. ✅ Testing and Validation
 CANopen data successfully sent from XMC4800 and received via EL6751.

 EtherCAT master sees consistent and correct data updates.

 Error handling and watchdog recovery tested.

 Edge cases tested (e.g., CAN node disconnection, reset, or timeout).

 Real-time data logging via TwinCAT Scope or equivalent validated.

5. ✅ Documentation & Artifacts
 Source code pushed to GitHub with README and build instructions.

 CANopen node configuration and EDS file generated and shared.

 Screenshots or TwinCAT project file demonstrating working communication.

 Known issues or limitations documented.
