## Description

Definition of Done (DoD):
 Hardware digital output pin configured for relay control (ON/OFF).
 Relay switching verified (load connected and disconnected properly).
 DHAB S/157 current sensor interface implemented.
 ADC pin configured and calibrated for sensor output.
 Conversion function from sensor ADC reading â†’ actual current (A).
 Load ON/OFF state is synchronized with relay control command.
 Current measurement validated when load is ON (compare with expected load current).
 Safety check: Relay OFF when system reset or fault occurs.
