## Description

Initiate the design of a first module for prismatic LFP cells. This is an early phase design that will be later broken down into more issues.

The module shall fulfil the below requirements:
- Be portable (<25kg)
- Be electrically safe (<60VDC)
- Contain 1 CMU
- Be scalable by connecting to other modules in series

DoD:

- The design should include a protective casing (steel) that is easy to manufacture and assemble.
- The design should include a CMU adapter PCB that measures the cell voltage and temperature and allows for configurable passive cell balancing (bleeding resistors).
- The design should include a safe and finger-proof design busbar and connectors (amphenol).
