## Description

Definition of Done (DoD):

TSMaster CAN database (DBC) is correctly imported and mapped to all BMS signals.
Configuration created to decode and log:
12 cell voltages
Pack voltage and pack current
State of Charge (SOC)
Temperature values
Link voltage
Signals are verified on live CAN measurement in TSMaster.
Data is logged and can be exported to CSV/Excel for analysis.
The configuration file is uploaded to the common repository for team use.
