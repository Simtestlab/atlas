## Description

DoD : Convert the dynamic public URL provided by ngrok into a static URL and configure it to serve all web resources seamlessly.

Issue: When using a dynamic URL, the connection becomes inaccessible if the prompt is closed, as the link changes. To address this, a static IP should be used to ensure a consistent and reliable URL.
