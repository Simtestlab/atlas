## Description

(DoD):
As a developer, I need to resolve the issues causing the XWiki system to crash.

Tasks to be done:

- Investigate and fix the issue of slow XWiki access.
- Ensure XWiki pages update correctly after database modifications.
- Resolve the issue of media files not being assigned properly.
- Migrate the host system to a new machine.
- Set up a dedicated local host machine specifically for the development server.
- Assemble and configure a Linux machine for development purposes.
- no problem with backup all are in github
