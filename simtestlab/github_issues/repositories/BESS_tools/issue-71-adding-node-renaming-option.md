## Description

**Port Node high light**: First as we previously implemented node high lighting for other nodes, First planning to implement the same for in port and out port nodes too.
**Renaming for Inport and outport**: When an inport or outport node is selected Below the node it should show an option below each node to rename it, and the renamed label should be saved to the json asynchronously.
**Other Nodes renaming**: We already have a space at the top each node we should add a edit icon to rename the node.
