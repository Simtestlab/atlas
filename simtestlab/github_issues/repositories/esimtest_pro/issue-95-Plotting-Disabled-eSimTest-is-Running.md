## Description

@aeroramesh @AgilanArulchelvam @RajavelRajendiran @sajimotrax

- While running the model on eSimTest, we were able to plot the graph, but we were not supposed to.
- If we try to plot, a popup should appear indicating that eSimTest is currently running.
- If we forget to plot an input, we can use the Stop button.
