## Description

In the plot window, with a model loaded, there is a tab named "Plot 1." After dragging and dropping signals from the data window into the plot window, if you delete the "Plot 1" tab and then attempt to filter signals (e.g., Non-zero signals or Plotted signals), the "Plot 1" tab still appears as per the filter options despite being deleted.
