## Description

DoD: Analyze sequencing data using FastQC, interpret key metrics (e.g., read quality, GC content, duplication levels), ensure data readiness for downstream analysis, and document the findings.

**Definition**
The process of actively using the FastQC software to analyze and evaluate the quality of sequencing data through practical exercises. This involves interpreting metrics such as read quality, GC content, and sequence duplication levels to ensure the data is suitable for downstream analysis.
