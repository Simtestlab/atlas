## Description

_Define the PCB board outline for the Falcon Adaptor, including dimensions, mounting holes, connector placements, and mechanical constraints. This serves as the foundation before starting PCB layout._
**Tasks**

- [ ]  Define overall board dimensions (length Ã— width).
- [ ]  Add mounting holes (location, size, keep-out areas).
- [ ]  Place mechanical features (slots, cut-outs, alignment marks).
- [ ]  Ensure clearance for all external connectors (EtherCAT, Ethernet, I/O, Power).
- [ ]  Import or create reference drawings from mechanical CAD (if available).
- [ ]  Document mechanical stack-up requirements (board thickness, layer count, etc.).

**Deliverables**

1. mechanical/board_outline.dxf (or other CAD source).
2. Screenshot / diagram of board outline with dimensions.
3. Updated PCB project file with outline and mounting holes.
4. Notes on mechanical constraints in docs/board_outline.md.
