## Description

**Description**
_Route all I/O signal lines between the MCU, peripheral ICs, and external connectors according to the defined port mapping. Ensure proper signal grouping, trace organization, and connector pin alignment to maintain clarity, serviceability, and signal reliability._

**Tasks**
- [ ]  Finalize all I/O port pin mappings based on the schematic.
- [ ]  Route signals between MCU and automotive-grade I/O connectors as defined in the schematic.
- [ ]  Group signals logically (Digital Inputs, Outputs, Analog, Communication, etc.).
- [ ]  Maintain consistent trace width based on current/signal type.
- [ ]  Keep short, direct routes for critical I/O signals to reduce interference.
- [ ]  Provide ground reference traces or plane near signal lines for signal integrity.
- [ ]  Label all net names clearly and verify they match the hierarchical block definitions.
- [ ]  Maintain connector pin order consistent with mechanical drawings.
- [ ]  Review DRC and net connectivity post-routing.

**Deliverables**

- Completed I/O routing section in PCB layout.
- DRC and connectivity check report.
- Screenshot showing routed I/O signal groups.
