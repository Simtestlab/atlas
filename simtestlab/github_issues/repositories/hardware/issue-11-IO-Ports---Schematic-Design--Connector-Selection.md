## Description

**ðŸ§© I/O Ports â€“ Schematic Design & Automotive Connector Selection**

**Description:**
_This issue is to track the design of the I/O Ports section of the Falcon Adaptor PCB. The goal is to create the schematic for all I/O interfaces and select suitable automotive-grade connectors that comply with industry standards._

**Tasks:**

 

- [x] Define all I/O signals and group them logically.
- [ ]  Design the schematic for the I/O Ports section.
- [ ]  Research and select appropriate automotive-standard connectors for each I/O group.
- [ ]  Create schematic symbols and PCB footprints for the selected connectors.
- [ ]  Verify mechanical fit, pin count, current rating, and environmental specifications (vibration, temperature, ingress protection).

**Notes:**

- Prefer sealed or rugged automotive-grade connectors with locking mechanisms.
- Choose widely available parts from reputed connector manufacturers.
- Document the pin mapping for each connector.

**Deliverables:**

- Completed schematic sheet for the I/O Ports
- BOM entries for selected connectors
- Library symbols and footprints
- Connector pin mapping documentation
