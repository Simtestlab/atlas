## Description

**ðŸ§© Power Block â€“ Schematic Design & Part Selection**

**Description:**
_This issue is to track the creation of the Power Block section of the Falcon Adaptor PCB. The goal is to design the schematics for the power supply and select suitable components for the required voltage rails._

**Tasks:**

- [x] Draw the schematic for the Power Block.
- [x] Identify and select appropriate parts for:
- [x] 5 V LDO regulator
- [x] 3.3 V LDO regulators
- [x] 2.5 V LDO regulators
- [x] Create schematic symbols and footprints for the chosen LDO parts in the component library.
- [x] Verify availability and electrical ratings (input/output voltage, current capacity, thermal performance).

**Notes:**

- Ensure all chosen LDOs meet the load current requirements and thermal constraints.
- Prefer parts with good documentation and availability from major suppliers.

**Deliverables:**

- Completed schematic sheet for the Power Block
- Library symbols and footprints
