## Description

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a cutting-edge technology that enables high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA, providing a comprehensive view of the genetic material in a sample. Unlike traditional Sanger sequencing, which sequences one DNA fragment at a time, NGS processes millions of fragments simultaneously, making it faster, more efficient, and cost-effective.
