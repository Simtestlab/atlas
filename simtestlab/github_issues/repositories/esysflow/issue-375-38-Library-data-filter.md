## Description

DOD: The current sidebar displays nodes from all categories. It should be updated to include a filter option for selecting nodes by category.
	Additionally, a configuration file is needed to determine the library based on the user type.
	For instance, an electrical engineer should have the ability to filter nodes relevant to their field based on their user type.
