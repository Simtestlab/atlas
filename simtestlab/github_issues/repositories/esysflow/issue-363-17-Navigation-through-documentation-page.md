## Description

DOD: When an item (node) is clicked in the project tree, which is common for both tabs, the navigation should happen to that particular itemâ€™s documentation (a typical wiki page setup).

<img width="617" height="297" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a2820a9-c458-4ecf-a669-8bd84cda7192" />

And if a user switches back to the node view the same respective item should be navigated and visible in the node view (current canvas).
	The navigation in the canvas page is already done, we need to ensure the documentation tab uses the same setup instead of a standalone version.
