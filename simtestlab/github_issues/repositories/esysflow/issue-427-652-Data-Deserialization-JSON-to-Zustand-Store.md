## Description


# Data Deserialization: JSON to Zustand Store

## Objective

Develop a robust deserialization mechanism to load graph data from a previously stored JSON file into the Zustand store, ensuring the data populates correctly and updates the application's UI. This functionality will facilitate future integration with backend API calls.

## Requirements

The system must deserialize JSON data, previously serialized from the Zustand store, back into the current Zustand store instance. The process should accurately reconstruct the graph data for all nodes within flows and subflows, maintaining the hierarchical structure, and ensure seamless UI updates via React hooks.

### JSON Structure Example

```json
{
  "flows": [
    {
      "flow-1": [
        {
          "node-1": [] // Graph data
        },
        {
          "node-2": [] // Graph data
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "flow-2": [
        {
          "node-1": [] // Graph data
        },
        {
          "node-2": [] // Graph data
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Implementation Steps

1.  **JSON Data Retrieval**:
    
    -   Fetch the JSON file from the application's storage (e.g., `public` folder) based on a version ID.
    -   Validate that the version ID of the stored JSON matches the current diagram version to ensure data compatibility.
2.  **Data Mapping**:
    
    -   Parse the JSON data and map its structure to align with the Zustand store's schema.
    -   Ensure the hierarchical relationships (flows, subflows, and nodes) and associated graph data are accurately reconstructed.
3.  **Store Update and UI Synchronization**:
    
    -   Update the Zustand store with the deserialized data, ensuring all graph data is correctly assigned to the corresponding nodes.
    -   Verify that React hooks and UI components reflect the updated store data, supporting both JSON-based updates and existing user input mechanisms.
    -   Implement error handling to manage parsing or version mismatch issues, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Considerations

-   Optimize the deserialization process for performance, particularly for large JSON files.
-   Validate the JSON structure to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies during deserialization.
-   Ensure compatibility with existing user input mechanisms to avoid conflicts in data updates.
-   Prepare the system for future integration with backend API calls by maintaining a consistent data structure.
- Modularize the files, document the function calling in the existing files for reviewer and implement testcases for the written utilites and functions.
