## Issues that has to be fixed:
- The interactivity is enabled only after deselecting node.
- Latency in rendering the node initially
- Modularize the hooks and component into reusable and efficient
- Add option to change the graph type inside the sheet view

Note:
You can refer the code in the esysflow_feature for updation without selected Node object.
