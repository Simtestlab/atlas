## Description


# Data Serialization: Zustand Store to Local JSON

## Objective

Implement a robust data serialization mechanism to persist and retrieve graph data from a Zustand store to a local JSON file, maintaining the hierarchical structure of the application's project tree.

## Requirements

The system must serialize the Zustand store's graph data into a JSON file, preserving the parent-child relationships (flows and nodes) as defined in the application's project tree. The JSON structure should mirror the hierarchical organization, enabling seamless storage and retrieval for review and analysis.

### JSON Structure Example

```json
{
  "flows": [
    {
      "flow-1": [
        {
          "node-1": [] // Graph data
        },
        {
          "node-2": [] // Graph data
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "flow-2": [
        {
          "node-1": [] // Graph data
        },
        {
          "node-2": [] // Graph data
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Data Retrieval**:
    
    -   Access the entire flow and subflow data from the Zustand store.
    -   Ensure all relevant graph data, including parent-child relationships, is extracted accurately.
2.  **JSON Construction**:
    
    -   Transform the retrieved data into a JSON structure that reflects the parent-child hierarchy (flows and nodes) as shown in the example.
    -   Map the graph data to the corresponding nodes, ensuring data integrity and consistency with the project tree structure.
3.  **File Storage**:
    
    -   Save the generated JSON file to the application's `public` folder for review and analysis.
    -   Implement error handling to manage file writing issues and ensure reliable storage.
    - The filename of the JSON should match the current version ID of the flow diagram.

## Considerations

-   Ensure the serialization process is optimized for performance, especially for large datasets.
-   Validate the JSON structure to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies.
-   Provide mechanisms to handle file overwrites or version control if needed for analysis.
- Modularize the files, document the function calling in the existing files for reviewer and implement testcases for the written utilites and functions.
