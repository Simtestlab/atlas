## Description

DOD: Currently every user can edit the nodes in a collaborative window, it need to be 	modified to an access based editing option where once a user frozen a project and if working on a project.
Only that particular user should be able to make changes to the current flow until it has been unfreeze.
	This task depends on the access privilege and flowâ€™s state management so we need to ensure those tasks are completed before working on it.
