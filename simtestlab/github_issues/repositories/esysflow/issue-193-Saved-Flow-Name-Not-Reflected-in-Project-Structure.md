## Description

## I created a project as a Node, which generates a default "main." It includes an "Add" option that allows creating new files, with nodes added as a flow. When saving this flow, it prompts for a name, but that name is not reflected in the project structure.

Should the saved name be reflected in the project structure, or should we remove the option to name the file?
