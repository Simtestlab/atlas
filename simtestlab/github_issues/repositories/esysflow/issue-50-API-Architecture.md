## Description

# DOD:
As a developer I will create a API architecture of how and when the data has to be send and received primarily.

## Goals of Architecture:
- How, When and where a data is handled.
- How and When the diagram data is saved.
- When adding a custom node, How it is reflected in the database.
- Events that decided the CRUD operations of data.
- What are the Primary and Foreign keys need without data repetition.
- Need to make the performance and asynchronous nature as priority. 

- Creating tables for the following and relationship among them
> 1. flows
> 2. nodes inside diagram
> 3. saving diagram data
> 4. library data
> 5. tab data (for navigation)
