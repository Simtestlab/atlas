## Description

DOD: As a developer, please design the layout for the issue page, incorporating a dedicated space for the header and structured sections for key status categories, including Backlog, Bugs, In Progress, Hold, Review, and Done. Initially, focus solely on the root layout, with subsequent efforts directed toward developing each individual component separately.
