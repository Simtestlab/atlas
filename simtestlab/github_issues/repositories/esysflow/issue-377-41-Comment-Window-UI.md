## Description

DOD: Create an option inside the canvas where it should render 	existing chat history if any exists, and option to send comments with tagging a user, node and edge.
	
We can use a # symbol to tag a node, $ symbol to tag an edge and @ symbol to tag a user who has access to the current project.
	Once a symbol is typed the node, edge and user list should be automatically rendered.

	Also before working on this task we need to ensure the APIs needed for the tasks related to user access and privileges exist.
