## Description

## We need to find a efficient back end environment to run **Esysflow** which has been currently build with **Next.js**:

### Requirements:
1. Price for the premium membership should be effective compare to other platforms.
2. Our Esysflow requires more complex computing power if the diagram gets complex so we need to ensure that the hosted platform supports the limit.

These are the main requirements for now and will continue working on other requirements.
