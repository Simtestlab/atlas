## Description

DOD: We have an existing properties UI with some predefined input fields. But that has to be matured with a refined UI as mentioned below.
	It should include options to edit the properties of a node which includes the value of the handlers, range and constraints if it exists.

We need to design this window as a dialog box with tabs, where the first tab manages handler input values and the second tab allows viewing and editing of documentation data.
