## Description

DOD: The current canvas allows users to commit versions, creating a new version each time and enabling users to revert to previous versions.
	This functionality needs modification so that when a version requires review, any user can tag the project owner for review, or the owner can initiate a review.
	A new version should only be created after the project ownerâ€™s approval. Once a version is reviewed and approved, it becomes read-only, and a new version is set as the current version.

When a user clicks the commit option, a dialogue box similar to the one shown below should pop-up where the user should enter the name and description for the current commit. Here the project owner will be selected as owner automatically.
	Once a version is moved to review it automatically gets frozen and when the review is done , a new version will be created as a working version for that branch.
