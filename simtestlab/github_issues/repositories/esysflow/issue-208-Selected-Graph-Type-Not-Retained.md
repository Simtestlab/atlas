## Description

## I created a project and added a Vector node from the Inputs section. When I click on the Vector node, a dialog box appears with different graph types. We can choose any graph based on the requirementsâ€”like we selected 'Scatter Geo' and connected it to the Scatter Geo node. I saved the project, but when I tried to reopen the Vector node, the previously selected graph type was not reflected.
