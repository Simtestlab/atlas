## Description

DOD: Currently, selecting a graph type navigates to the sheet window, but users cannot change the graph type within that window.
	To switch types, users must create a new window and select a different graph type. Add an option to allow users to switch between graph types within the same window.
	The main goal of this task is to update it to the store properly and ensure the existing asynchronous updation works fine.
