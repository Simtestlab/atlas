## Description

Once the API endpoints are created and tested with postman we can directly implement those in the UI and need to ensure all the UI elements to perform CRUD operation exist and functions as expected.

	Ensure the heading, images are stored and fetched as expected and the entire documentation’s format shouldn’t change across renders.
