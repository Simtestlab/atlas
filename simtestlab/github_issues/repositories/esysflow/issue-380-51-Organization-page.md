## Description

DOD: Currently, project-based management serves as the entry-level access for an owner. We need to introduce organization-based management, where an organization can include users as members.
	Upon logging in, a new user can either join an existing organization or create a new one if necessary.
	The existing project page will be updated to incorporate organization settings and details.
