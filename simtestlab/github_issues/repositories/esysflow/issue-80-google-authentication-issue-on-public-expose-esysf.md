# Issue:
While locally running the esysflow the login is working fine. But while mapping it with ngnix it results in the following error.

Even thought the URL is mapped in the Google Developer Console it is producing the error.

# Why Login is needed:
- Currently the User ID which is generated by logging in is needed for the neo4j database to store the relevant information.
- If we need to remove the login functionality the future commits with the back end configuration will not work/
