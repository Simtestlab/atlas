## Description

DOD: 	A page similar to GitHub project page where issues with different stages like Backlog, In Progress, Hold, Bug, Testing, Review and Done.
	Each Task should contain an assignee, label, start date, end date. Also it should be tagged with a flow or sub-flow.
	When clicked on a flow inside the task we need to navigate to that particular flow.
	Each task page should have an option to add commands and update the state of that particular flow.

These functionalities are more similar to the comment window but specific to a particular flow instead of an entire diagram.
