## Description

**1.Route power and ground planes**
**Description:** _Route large, continuous power and ground planes for optimal performance and reduced noise._
**DoD:** _Power and ground planes are routed correctly, ensuring low impedance and effective signal reference._

**2.Route high-speed or critical signals first**
**Description:** _Route critical signals (e.g., high-speed data lines, clock signals) first to ensure signal integrity and minimize_ interference.
**DoD:** _High-speed signals are routed correctly, with proper trace width and differential pair routing if necessary._

**3.Route remaining signals while adhering to design rules**
**Description:** _Route all other signals, ensuring compliance with design rules such as trace width, spacing, and layer usage._
**DoD:** _All signals are routed, and all design rules (trace width, clearance, etc.) are followed._

**4.Add vias and optimize trace routing**
**Description:** _Minimize via usage and optimize trace routing to reduce signal path length and potential interference._
**DoD:** _The number of vias is minimized, and traces are routed efficiently without introducing signal degradation._

**5.Ensure proper clearance between traces and pads**
**Description:** _Ensure there is adequate space between traces, pads, and vias to avoid short circuits and meet manufacturing specifications._
**DoD:** _Trace and pad clearances meet all manufacturing specifications and design rules._
