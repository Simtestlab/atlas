## Description

**1.Place connectors and critical components first**
**Description:** _Place connectors and critical components (e.g., power ICs, high-speed interfaces) in optimal positions on the PCB._
**DoD:** _Connectors and critical components are placed in appropriate positions, adhering to design constraints (e.g., signal flow, thermal requirements)._

**2.Group components by functionality or signal flow**
**Description:** _Place components in groups based on their functionality (e.g., power section, signal processing section) for easier routing and logical flow._
**DoD:** Components are placed logically, with groups aligned to the signal flow to facilitate routing.

**3.Adjust placement for optimal routing and thermal performance**
**Description:** _Position components to minimize routing complexity, maintain signal integrity, and manage heat dissipation._
**DoD:** _The placement ensures efficient routing, thermal management, and minimal interference between components._
