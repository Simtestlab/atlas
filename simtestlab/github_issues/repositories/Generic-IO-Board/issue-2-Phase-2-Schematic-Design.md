## Description

**1.Select components based on requirements**
**Description:** _Choose components that meet the design objectives, considering power consumption, size, availability, and cost._
**DoD:** _All components are selected and their datasheets are reviewed for compatibility. No missing or incompatible components._

**2.Create or import component symbols and footprints**
**Description:** _Define symbols for each component and import or create footprints for accurate physical placement on the PCB._
**DoD:** _Component symbols and footprints are created or imported, and verified for accuracy in the design._

**3.Draw the schematic using an EDA tool ( Altium)**
**Description:** _Design the circuit using schematic capture in an EDA tool (Altium). This involves connecting components and defining electrical connections._
**DoD:** _The schematic is complete with no errors or missing connections. All components are placed logically and correctly._

**4.Annotate components and assign reference designators**
**Description:** _Assign unique reference designators to each component for clarity in later stages._
**DoD:** _Every component has a unique reference designator, and the schematic is easy to follow._

**5.Perform an Electrical Rules Check (ERC)**
**Description:** _Run ERC to ensure there are no issues with electrical connections or design errors._
**DoD:** _ERC shows no errors or warnings. All connections are correct and the schematic is electrically sound._
