## Description

**1.Perform continuity and short-circuit tests**
**Description:** _Check for continuity between all connections and test for any short circuits._
**DoD:** _Continuity and short-circuit tests show no errors._

**2.Power up the PCB and verify basic functionality**
**Description:** _Power the PCB and verify that basic functionality (e.g., power rails, LEDs) works as expected._
**DoD:** _The board powers up without issues, and basic functions (e.g., LED lighting, power supply voltages) are verified._

**3.Conduct functional testing of the complete board**
**Description:** _Perform full functional tests based on the design requirements to ensure the board operates correctly._
**DoD:** _Full functional tests are completed, and the board operates as intended in all modes._
