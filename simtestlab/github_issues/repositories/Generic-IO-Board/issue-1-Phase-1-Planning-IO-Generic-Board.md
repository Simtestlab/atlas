## Description

**1.Define design objectives (functionality, size, power requirements)**
**Description:** _Outline the boardâ€™s purpose (e.g., signal processing, power regulation), size constraints, and power needs. Identify the required connectors, interfaces, and components._
**DoD:** _Clear design objectives are documented, including board size, power ratings, and functionality. No ambiguity in requirements._

**2.Collect component datasheets and specifications**
**Description:** _Gather datasheets for all components to ensure they meet electrical and mechanical requirements._
**DoD:** _All required datasheets are collected and stored. Components are verified for compatibility with the design._

**3.Determine PCB material, layer count, and any special requirements (e.g., impedance control)**
**Description:** _Decide on PCB material (e.g., FR4), the number of layers, and special features such as controlled impedance, blind/buried vias, or thermal management._
**DoD:** _Material selection and specifications are finalized. Special requirements (e.g., impedance control) are clearly defined._
