## Description

DOD: As a developer maintain the state of the bottom navbar which changes while navigating between pages, instead it should be persistant while changes across tabs.

For example, in the below provided sample we are in the report data page, while navigating to other tab and coming back, it is directly navigating to the Patient page. But it is expected to stay in the Report data persistently.
