## Description

Description:
Design core C structs for cell voltage, current, temperature, SOC, SOE, and overall system state. These types and clear API definitions in header files form the backbone for reliability, consistency, and cross-module communication in BMS algorithms.

DOD: Structs and enums defined in header files, commented with units/ranges. @prabhagaran @aeroramesh
