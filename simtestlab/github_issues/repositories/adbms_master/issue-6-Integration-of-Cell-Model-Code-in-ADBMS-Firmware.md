## Description

DOD: 
The cell model code is successfully integrated into the ADBMS firmware without compilation errors.
The integrated code accurately processes and updates cell voltage, temperature, and state-of-charge (SoC) data.
Communication between the ADBMS and the cell model is verified through SPI/UART, ensuring correct data exchange.
The integrated system is tested under various load conditions, with results matching expected behavior.
Documentation is updated, including implementation details, test results, and usage instructions
