## Description

DOD: As a Devoleper need to prepare the schematic drawing for XMC HAT

This project is based on XMC4800 development board PCB , which makes communication between EtherCat and SPI for Maze Board. which acts as master and communicates with slave devices in the maze board, This project includes schematic drawing , Layout design , manufacturing , and testing.
the task are divided  into:
1. Gathering the information about the XMC4800 and Supported pheripherals
2. Preparing For Schematics with Specified components libraries 
3. Cover Page Design
4. Block Diagram Design. 
5. XMC microcontroller basic connections. 
6. EtherCat connection between XMC4800 and EtherCAT.
7. Connector Connection. 
8. layout placement 
9. stack up setting 
10. Routing 
11.Review.
12.Manufacturing
